# FoodHub Data Analysis: Insights into Restaurant Performance and Customer Satisfaction

### Project Overview
This project involves analyzing food order data from a fictional food aggregator company, **FoodHub**, which provides delivery services from various restaurants through its smartphone app. The goal is to analyze order data to derive insights that can enhance customer experience and optimize business operations.

### Context
With the growing number of restaurants in New York, FoodHub serves busy professionals and students by offering a seamless online food delivery service. By analyzing stored data, the company aims to:
- Understand customer preferences.
- Improve restaurant partnerships.
- Optimize delivery logistics.

### Objectives
As a data scientist, you are tasked with answering key business questions to help FoodHub enhance its services. These insights will focus on restaurant demand, delivery performance, and customer satisfaction.

### Data Description
The dataset includes various aspects of food orders made through the FoodHub app:
- order_id: Unique identifier for each order.
- customer_id: Unique identifier for the customer.
- restaurant_name: Name of the restaurant.
- cuisine_type: Type of cuisine ordered.
- cost: Total cost of the order.
- day_of_the_week: Day when the order was placed (Weekday/Weekend).
- rating: Customer rating for the order (out of 5).
- food_preparation_time: Time taken by the restaurant to prepare the food (in minutes).
- delivery_time: Time taken by the delivery person to deliver the food (in minutes).

### Tools and Libraries
The following libraries were used in this project:
- Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation.
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization.
- SciPy for statistical analysis.

### Key Features
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data Visualization
- Statistical Testing
- Business Recommendations

### Conclusions
- **Popular Cuisines:** American, Japanese, and Italian cuisines are the most popular, especially on weekends.
- **Customer Satisfaction:** Despite many unrated orders, high ratings dominate, indicating overall satisfaction.
- **Operational Independence:** Cost, food preparation time, and delivery time are independent factors.  
- **Weekend Efficiency:** Orders double on weekends, but delivery times remain shorter.

### Recommendations
- **Focus on Popular Cuisines:** Highlight American, Japanese, and Italian dishes in marketing, while promoting less popular options.
- **Encourage Ratings:** Use incentives to gather more ratings for better customer feedback.
- **Target Budget-Conscious Customers:** Offer deals in the $10â€“$20 range.
- **Optimize Weekend Staffing:** Maintain short delivery times by staffing adequately on weekends.
- **Continuous Process Improvement:** Keep refining operations to sustain performance during peak times.
- **Expand Menu Options:** Introduce more popular cuisines in high-demand areas.
